# printf
Small printf function (and variants) using only small system calls and no floating point operations. This is intended for use in boot mode, or on systems that need to print floatinf point numbers, but have no floating point ability for the binary-to-decimal conversion.

Was originally a university project I did with a classmate at the Faculty of Sciences of Sorbonne University, Paris.
I recently revisited this project and am in the process of cleaning up the code, and preparing a PDF detailing the mathematics behind the conversion algorithm.
